In computer jargon, the term "bug" refers to an error in a program. The process of systematically locating and fixing these errors is referred to as debugging.

As you do more and more programming, you will naturally encounter a lot of errors ( or bugs). Causing, understanding, and fixing errors is an important part of programming. Python will do its best to run anything that you tell it to run, but if it can't understand what you're asking, then it won't run the program. At the same time, Python will show error messages to try to give you a bit of information about what went wrong, in order to help you try to fix it.
