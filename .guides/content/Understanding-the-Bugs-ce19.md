The error looks quite unfriendly. However, if you read the error carefully and look back through your code, you should be able to work out what to do to fix it. Have a look at the explanation below.

The error message is extremely useful because it tells us exactly where in our code there is an error.  In the second line of the error message, we are directed to the location of the error in our program: 
![error_line_8](https://global-pixel.codio.io/error_line_8.png)
File "error-1.py" refers to the name of the program file. "line 8" is the location of the bug in our program. 
This is the error, or NameError :
![Not-Defined](https://global-pixel.codio.io/not_defined.png)
This error is telling us that that the variable number4 is not defined anywhere in our code although we have tried to use it.
