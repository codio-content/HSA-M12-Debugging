### Challenge 6.1:  
The program on the left is supposed to calculate student semester grades using the 40-40-20 method. 

The Semester Grade is calculated by adding together: 
40% (First Nine Weeks Grade Average) + 40% (Second Nine Weeks Grade Average) + 20% (Semester Test Grade)

### HINT: 
Use a calculator to double check the math(calculation) to make sure that the program is printing the correct grade. 

Try using different values for the first and second nine weeks grades also to verify that the final semester grade is accurate.
