 


There are three common types of errors can occur in programming:</p>
    
   <list>
- Syntax errors: typographic errors (omitting a quote or misspelling a variable name)
- Logic errors: flaws in design or implementation of the program(program produces the wrong result)
- Run-time errors: operations are applied to illegal values (attempting to multiply a string or divide by Zero)
