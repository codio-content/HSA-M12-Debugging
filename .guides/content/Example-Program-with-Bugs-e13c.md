Review the sample program.  This program accepts two inputs: 1. greeting and 2. name
The two variables are then combined into one sentence in line 6. 
Next, we print: 1. greeting, 2. name, and 3. sentence

Once we run the source code, or program we see that we've made an error on line 14. 

{Run}(python3 error-4.py)

Our error is due to a capitalization error which is a <b> syntax error </b>.  Edit the program and correct the error by: 
1. Changing the capital "S" in line 14 to a lowercase "s"

Now when we run the program there are no errors:
{Run}(python3 error-4.py)
