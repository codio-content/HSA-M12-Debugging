### Syntax Errors

Syntax errors can be detected before your program begins to run. These types of errors are usually typing mistakes, but more generally it means that there is some problem with the structure of your program.  An example of a common syntax error is using a single equal sign assignment operator "=" instead of the double equal sign which is the comparison operator "== ". 
This bug causes the following error: "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" to appear. 
The "=" is the assignment operator while "==" is the "is equal to" comparison operator.
